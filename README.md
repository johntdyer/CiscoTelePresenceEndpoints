# CiscoTelePresenceEndpoints
I'm pulling together code I've seen to try and make a simplified Cisco 
endpoint experience and get Customer Satisfaction results, then push 
the results someplace so they can be analized. 

I have borrowed samples from:
  Cisco Dev Net 
    (https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/roomdevices-macros-samples  -- One Button to Dial and Customer Satisfaction)
  
  ObjectIsAdvantag
    (https://github.com/ObjectIsAdvantag/xapi-samples  -- the macros section) 
    (but also look at https://github.com/ObjectIsAdvantag/xapi-samples/tree/master/jsxapi/httpfeedback)
    
 Someday I'll learn to properly attribute.
